# OpenCiv

A turn based strategy game, with a rouge-like tile set. Inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization, 
where it strives to improve on certain aspects that were lacking in the series, and experiment with new features. 
If you like game development, java, or pixel art, consider contributing. We can make something really great. 

Eventually, I'd like to add support modding through [LUAJ](https://www.gamedevelopment.blog/using-luaj-scripting-to-allow-modding-in-games/).

To run & modify the game --
* Install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Run -> ```git clone https://github.com/rhin123/OpenCiv.git```
* Open Eclipse or any other java editor, and ```import grade project``` (Eclipse is recommended, haven't tested on other IDEs)
* To get the game running you would run the OpenCiv-lwjgl3 ```Lwjgl3Launcher.java``` class & the OpenCiv-server ```Server.jar``` To start the Client & Server

Right click -> Run as -> Java Application
